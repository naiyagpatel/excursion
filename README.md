# Excusrion Project
In this project, I created a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” 

## Technologies Used:
This page is made with help of HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. 

## About Web Page: 
The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

Note: You might not see the autoplay of Video if your browser is not supported. You can definitely see this working in Microsoft Edge.
